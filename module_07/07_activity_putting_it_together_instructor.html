		<p>The health professionals at our Montmartre and District Integrated Health Care Centre have participated in a year-end dinner to celebrate a successful year serving the Montmartre community and to recognize any staff changes, such as re-deployments, retirements, engagements, or other personal milestones. I am sending you this report to present options for the venue for that dinner in preparation for our upcoming staff meeting. This will be the seventh year we have held the dinner. We have currently about 20 staff. We usually get about 18-20 people who can attend the annual dinner, held in June before staff summer vacations begin. We also invite the physician, Mallory Engels, who is on site twice a week, but she is not often available for the dinner. After some discussion at the April staff meeting, we reached a consensus to travel to Regina, only an hour away, for the annual dinner. This year we wanted to go someplace different, instead of the Sisters&rsquo; Boutique and Bistro in town, but within a reasonable driving distance and at a reasonable cost. The local restaurant is small and can no longer accommodate our growing staff complement comfortably. The staff asked John Fisk from the lab and me to research possible restaurants in Regina. We searched for restaurants that had a variety of foods on the menu, including low sodium and gluten free options. We looked first online at Regina restaurants and selected three to visit. We made a trip to Regina on Saturday, May 3, and managed to see all three. The three restaurants are all in the downtown core. Menus for all three restaurants are available online. All options are close to all the downtown shopping and entertainment in Regina for those who want to stay for the evening. The Copper Kettle Restaurant is on Scarth Street in Downtown Regina. The restaurant has an extensive menu of Mediterranean foods that includes soups, salads, stir-fry, and souvlaki. The house specialty is Eggplant a la Kettle, served with Parmesan and feta. The dinner menu includes pastas, pizza, and a variety of beef, chicken, and seafood dishes. Entrees typically cost $15 to $17 and the total dinner will cost $25 - $35.To accommodate us, they have two upstairs rooms for up to 16, and one large upstairs dining room for up to 50 people. Michi Japanese Restaurant and Sushi Bar is also on Scarth Street in Downtown Regina. The menu is traditional Japanese and includes sushi, tempura, sashimi, and noodle and rice dishes. Cost per dish is low, so the total price will depend on how much is ordered and what types of food. Some of the seafood dishes like smoked salmon and crab legs are more expensive. A typical dinner with a pot of green tea will cost from $20 to $35. To accommodate us, they have several Japanese-style dining rooms in addition to the main dining room and sushi bar. These each accommodate 8-10 people on cushions around a low central table behind a sliding paper curtain. We would need to book two of these for our group. Memories Fine Dining is on Victoria Avenue. The restaurant serves French and Greek menu items that vary considerably in cost, but all are high quality. They feature Angus beef for those who like a hearty prairie meal, and chicken, pork, or lamb dishes with rice or salad sides. Meals cost anywhere from $15 to $40. The restaurant has many private rooms that can be configured to accommodate any number of diners. The Trip Advisor website ranks the restaurants in the following order: Michi Japanese, Memories Fine Dining and Copper Kettle. All have received very good reviews from the public. On our visit, we found the staff helpful and attentive, and each restaurant was quite busy, suggesting they are popular with local diners. We believe that any of these options would make a good dinner venue. They all meet our dietary needs and at a competitive cost. They represent a variety of food styles and atmospheres, so the choice will be more about personal preferences. We can discuss and decide on the final choice of restaurant at the staff meeting this month. The date set for the dinner is Saturday, June 21, as previously announced. When we know how many people will attend, including spouses and significant others, I will follow up with a reservation for 5 p.m. on that date. I look forward to seeing you at the next staff meeting. Please let me know if you have any questions about the restaurants.</p>
