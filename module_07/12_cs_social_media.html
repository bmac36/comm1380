      <p>You are working in an office and your boss, Carlton Pierre, has called you into his office. A coworker just forwarded him article about social media and business called “How do you use social media to meet your business goals?” Carlton admits to you that he doesn’t know much about social media, or your organization’s use of it. He’d like to learn more and help ensure that your company’s social media strategy is effective but doesn’t have much time. He hands you the article and says, &quot;Here. Read this. Let me know what it says and have a look at how we’re using social media. Tell me how we are currently using Social Media and is there anything we could be doing better based on this article.&quot;.</p>

          <p>You are not required to search for and find information about social media from secondary sources (although you can); you are being given that information in the form of an article. </p>
          <p>The article provides some real life best practices and examples of how social media is currently being used by different businesses.</p>
          <p>The focus of the Social Media Project is to verify the key facts from this article and determine, through your own primary research, whether they apply to the situation you are trying to address, which in this case is the social media efforts of the company of your choice.</p>
          <p>The assignment allows you to choose which organization's social media presence you would like to analyse.</p>
