			<p>While a lot of workplace correspondence is administrative, the opportunity to add value in the workplace occurs when we solve problems and address issues. Organizations use a fact-based approach to make decisions, so it is important that your investigation is precise in distinguishing verifiable and credible facts from observations, speculation and opinion.  </p>
			<p>Depending on the scope, investigating an issue for the workplace may begin by looking for secondary research related to the situation. Because none of us can be experts in everything, a good place to start is with a search of what is known about the issue. The facts collected through secondary research can be used to analyse the issue you are investigating. </p>

				<p class="white-text">The process for collecting and presenting information is similar for all business documents. A good practice is to focus on gathering information and ideas, and organizing your points into an outline before composing and revising the information into a report.</p>

			<p>What you’re trying to do is demonstrate that your conclusion or recommendation is well-informed. You’ve researched what others have communicated about their experiences and interpreted it to apply to the problem you are trying to solve. When presenting an observation or impression, we need to indicate evidence of the elements that provided those impressions, such as an explanation of the pattern or example of the observation.</p>
			<p>Part of showing that you’ve done your research is ensuring that your report is well structured and logically ordered. This is done before you start writing your report by creating an outline with clear headings to structure your content.</p>

			<h2 class="">Creating Workplace documents</h2>
			<p>Each practice exercise this week is intended to make you familiar with the process for creating informal reports.</p>
			<h3>Step 1: Plan and outline</h3>
			<p>An effective strategy for generating workplace documents is to start by planning your approach, and capturing information and organize it using headings.</p>
			<h3>Step 2: Collect and analyse information</h3>
			<p>As you gather, and develop a better understanding of, the information you are collecting, you can refine the organization and adjust the structure using main headings and sub-headings.</p>
			<h3>Step 3: Revise headings and compose</h3>
			<p>While the amount of revision and editing depends upon the intended audience and purpose of your document, the amount of revision is generally reduced once you have all the information you require, organized into a clear structure.</p>
			<h3>Step 4: Conclusion and/or recommendation</h3>
			<p>Depending on the type of report you’re writing, you’ll need to wrap things up and summarize the information you want your reader to understand. You might also want to recommend next steps based on the information you’ve presented.</p>
